# Superhuman Clone Frontend

A high-performance email client frontend built as a speed-coding experiment using Cursor AI. This project aims to replicate the core functionality and keyboard-first experience of Superhuman.

## About

This project was created as an experiment to test the efficiency of modern AI-assisted development using Cursor. The goal was to build a functional Superhuman clone with:

-   90% of code generated through AI assistance
-   Rapid development cycle
-   Focus on keyboard-driven UI
-   Complex state management
-   Real-time email processing

## Core Features

-   Keyboard-first navigation and commands
-   Split-pane email viewing
-   Threaded conversations
-   Email composition with rich text
-   Contact suggestions
-   Folder management
-   Advanced shortcuts system
-   Email action system (archive, mark done, etc)

## Tech Stack

-   React/TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Electron (for desktop app)
-   Zustand (state management)
-   React Query (data fetching)

## Development Philosophy

The project demonstrates how AI can accelerate development while maintaining high code quality. By leveraging Cursor's AI capabilities, complex features like keyboard shortcuts, email parsing, and state management were implemented rapidly while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Status

This is an experimental project focused on the frontend implementation. Backend services are handled separately.

## Note

This is not affiliated with or endorsed by Superhuman - it's purely an educational experiment in AI-assisted development speed and capabilities.

## Note 2

This README was also written with AI. Sorry.
